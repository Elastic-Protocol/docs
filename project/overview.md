# Overview


## What is Elastic?

Elastic is a decentralized protocol for the creation of innovative self-collateralizing synthetic asset markets on the Ethereum blockchain.

Elastic’s synthetic assets, called Elastic Assets, automatically adjust their supply to collateralize the underlying resources they represent and can be used to form new markets for almost anything.

By removing the burden of collateral, Elastic solves the debt fluctuation issue experienced by other synthetic-type assets and removes the risk of liquidation entirely which in turn removes the barriers and risks associated with creating new markets.

Elastic is focussed on developing a sustainable community-driven ecosystem completely removed from the existing financial system for everything from Gamestop shares to a bottle of Coke.


## How Elastic works

Elastic has created contract templates which enable the rapid deployment of new Elastic Assets. Elastic’s contract templates are smart contracts that only require the configuration of a price feed (or basket of price feeds) before they can be deployed to create a new Elastic Asset market. Potential applications include anything for which a reliable price feed can be found such as: commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies, equities, indexes, products, and services.

New Elastic Assets are proposed by the community and must be approved by Elastic Token holders before going live. Every Elastic Asset contract is preprogrammed with a standard set of economic parameters which can be modified through a system of democratic governance before and after deployment.

Once created, new Elastic assets are distributed through automatically generated staking pools available to Elastic Token holders. These distribution pools serve two purposes, firstly they ensure the creation of fair and robust markets by incentivizing participation and liquidy and secondly they provide additional stability to the Elastic ecosystem by locking up Elastic Tokens and Elastic Token liquidity for a period of time.

Once distributed, anyone can trade Elastic Assets and participate in Elastic markets. Potential use cases include, but are not limited to: synthetic exposure to any asset, speculation, arbitrage, pricing for lending and debt and income generation through fees for providing liquidity.


## Elastic Token (ELS)

Elastic Token (ELS) is Elastic’s fixed-supply governance token which provides a launchpad for new Elastic Asset markets as well as a reward mechanism that incentivizes participation, stability, fairness and growth in the Elastic ecosystem.

ELS can be used to accumulate Elastic Assets allowing holders to gain exposure to the entire class of Elastic Assets and reduce their risk through diversification. 

Additionally, ELS provides a system of democratic governance. ELS holders steer the evolution of the Elastic protocol by proposing and approving new markets and deciding on the economic rules that govern those markets.


## Ecosystem incentive mechanisms

The Elastic ecosystem consists primarily of three types of users: Elastic Token (ELS) holders, Liquidity Providers (LP’s) and Elastic Asset (eAsset) holders. ELS holders are incentivised to create new eAsset markets, LP’s are incentivized to stabilize these markets, and eAsset holders are incentivized to participate in and grow these markets.

### Elastic Token (ELS) Holders

ELS holders are incentivized to stake their tokens in eAsset distribution pools to claim a share of new eAssets. This is designed to increase fairness, robustness, and efficiency in new markets by providing a wide distribution of token holders. By locking their tokens in distribution pools, ELS holders can leverage their position to accumulate a wide range of eAssets which they can then choose to sell, hold or leverage further to accumulate more ELS and subsequently more eAssets. This mechanism creates utility for ELS and is the primarily driver of its value.

### Liquidity Providers (LP’s)

LP’s are incentivized to provide liquidity for ELS and eAssets to increase stability and security in markets. There are two types of LP’s in the Elastic ecosystem: ELS LP’s and eAsset LP’s.

ELS LP’s provide liquidity for ELS and are incentivized to stake their tokens in eAsset distribution pools to claim a greater share of new eAssets than is available to regular ELS holders. In addition to earning fees from their LP tokens, by locking their tokens in distribution pools they can leverage their position to accumulate a wide range of eAssets which they can then choose to sell, hold or further leverage to accumulate more ELS.

eAsset LP’s provide liquidity directly to eAsset markets and are incentivized to stake their tokens in eAsset distribution pools to claim an even greater share of a new eAsset than both ELS holders and ELS LP’s. In addition to earning fees from their LP tokens, by locking their tokens in distribution pools they can leverage their position to supercharge their holdings of a particular eAsset which they can then choose to sell, hold or further leverage to mine ELS.

### Elastic Asset (eAsset) Holders

eAsset Holders are incentivized to stake their tokens in ELS reward pools. This is designed to increase participation and growth of eAsset markets by providing further utility for eAssets outside of primary purpose. By locking their tokens in ELS reward pools, eAssets holders can leverage their position to earn a steady drip of ELS which they can once again choose to sell, hold or further leverage to accumulate more eAssets and subsequently more ELS. This mechanism provides an additional driver of the value of an eAsset.
