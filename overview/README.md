# Overview

Elastic is a decentralized protocol enabling the growth of innovative synthetic asset markets on the Ethereum blockchain. Elasticâ€™s synthetic assets, called Elastic Assets (eAssets), track the price movements of real-world assets and self-collateralize by leveraging elastic-supply mechanisms. By removing the burden of collateral, Elastic solves the debt fluctuation issue experienced by other synthetic-type assets and enables the creation of new markets for tracking the price of anything. These markets are trustless and completely removed from the existing financial ecosystem.

Elastic Token (ELS) has a fixed-supply and provides an incentive/reward mechanism for participating in the ecosystem. New markets are seeded by Elastic Token (ELS) holders and liquidity providers with 100% of the supply being distributed proportionally to stakers at inception. Stakers are incentivized to leverage their tokens to enable fairly-distributed, robust and open markets. Participants in markets are in turn incentivized to stake their Elastic Assets to earn ELS, providing stability to markets and allowing them to grow. With new markets being created often, the value of ELS is derived from this circular mechanism.

Elastic is a project owned, developed and steered by its community: 90% of ELS tokens are reserved for the community, 100% of Elastic Assets are distributed to its users, its markets are maintained through ELS incentives, and the protocol evolves with new ideas through democratic governance.
